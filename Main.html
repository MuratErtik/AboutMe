Like these questions i always asking to myself and these quesitons is why i chose IT world.I want to be a software developer because when i coding i enjoy that. My goal is work as a Backend Developer because i like set some algorithms and manage database but be a backend developer is not my final decision because i interesting with DevOps,Database System Management and what is going on at the future i do not know so i just try to improve my algorithm skills and basic information.
