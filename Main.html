            Hello there! My name is Murat. it is my second years at Engineering. My major is Information System Engineering. I am twenty years old. I am going to Kocaeli University. I live in Istanbul.I chose IT world because I am familiar with computer and technology from when i was child. I always wondering what is going on background of computer. How software to direct hardware? How some applications developing and how they understand to our directions?  Like these questions i always asking to myself and these quesitons is why i chose IT world.I want to be a software developer because when i coding i enjoy that. My goal is work as a Backend Developer because i like set some algorithms and manage database but be a backend developer is not my final decision because i interesting with DevOps,Database System Management and what is going on at the future i do not know so i just try to improve my algorithm skills and basic information.

            In this section i want to talk about my lectures.When i was start coding with python programming language i learned conditional situations and loops but my algorithm skills was not good also i did not get OOP basics well. When i was at first year at university i had to learn c#. c# syntax more complicate than python and i could not get used to syntax but i pushed myself about OOP. At second year we got OOP lecture with Java programming language and i got it finally:) Also i was really like Java. When i coding with java i enjoy that(My favorite Programming language). By the way i got Linux OS Management lecture and i have been used Linux first time. I met with DevOps and i liked it at this lecture. I am continue learing Docker,Kubernetes etc. because i aware of if i will be a high quality backand developer i must know these tools very well.This term i got Database Management System and Data Structures and Algorithm Lectures. DBMS is very enjoyfully lecture but Data S. and algorithms is very tough. <br>
            if you also wondering other lecture you can see Curriculum via link: <a href="https://testapi.kocaeli.edu.tr/api/FileOperation?filePath=1061/Document/Files/2023/11/20231102_61ec4_bsm2020dersplani-9f5.pdf">Department Curriculum</a>
